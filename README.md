# Introduction

The **IPL (Indian Premier League)** cricket data analysis project aims to uncover performance patterns and insights at both the player and team levels. Through refining data types, resolving inconsistencies, and performing feature engineering, this project seeks to deepen the understanding of factors influencing match outcomes and player performances.

Utilizing **PySpark** in **Databricks**, the dataset has been transformed and enriched by creating new fields such as partnership runs, enhancing the analysis. Created visualizations using **Python** libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. A robust machine learning model pipeline will be developed to predict player and team performance, with MLflow employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models.

The insights gained from this analysis are expected to be valuable for developing strategies in team management, player selection, and game planning, contributing to a data-driven approach in the IPL. This could also benefit cricket enthusiasts in building their ideal teams.

# 🎯 Key Objectives:

🔹 Analyze IPL cricket data to uncover performance patterns and insights at both player and team levels.

🔹 Refine and enrich the dataset through advanced feature engineering and transformation functions to improve prediction accuracy.

🔹 Develop a robust machine learning pipeline to predict player and team performance, optimizing models using hyperparameter tuning.

🔹 Provide actionable insights for team management, player selection, and strategic game planning.

# 🔍 Key Insights:

🔹Top IPL Players with Most 'Player of the Match' Awards:
  AB de Villiers leads with the highest number of 'Player of the Match' awards, showcasing his exceptional performance.
  
🔹Performance Analysis of Top Batsmen Across IPL Overs:
  CH Gayle displays solid performance throughout but particularly shines in the middle overs, indicating a steady scoring rate.

🔹Bowlers vs. Batsmen: Uncovering the Toughest Matchups in IPL:
  Sunil Narine has dismissed Rohit Sharma the most times (9 wickets).

🔹IPL Teams' Performance Based on Toss Decisions and First Innings Batting:
  Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, and Rajasthan Royals have high win percentages when batting first, indicating strong performance when leading.

🔹Top IPL Bowlers: Total Wickets and Average Wickets Per Match:
  Lasith Malinga and Jasprit Bumrah are standout bowlers with the highest average wickets per match, each taking approximately 2 wickets per game.

🔹Patterns in Dismissal Types and Match Situations:

    🔸 "Caught" is the most common dismissal type, especially in league matches.
    
    🔸"Run out" dismissals occur later in high-stakes matches like finals and eliminators, reflecting increased risk-taking in crucial moments.
    
    🔸 Early wickets in qualifiers and finals are often due to "bowled" and "LBW" dismissals, highlighting effective bowling strategies in key games.

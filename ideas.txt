CLEANING
1. changed schema to correct schema (data types) by manually defining the schema structure.
2. The column "method" is used to indicate if the DLS (Duckworth-Lewis-Stern) method was used to calculate a new target score which is done in case the match is interupted does to rain.
For better clarity, we will rename the column to "DLS_used" and change the value to 0/1, 1 indicating that DLS was used.
3. Some matches have no winner, result or player_of_match because the match was abondanded due to weather conditions.
We will not consider these rows for our analysis and predictive modelling since its not adding in any value.

MATCHES

Analyses:
1. The team that has qualified till the Final the most times -- CLEAR 
2. Most common toss_decision by teams (do specific teams usually 
choose to bat or ball first) -- OKAYISH
3. The player_of_match most times won by a person --CLEAR
4. when a team decides to bat first - what target do they achieve -- IDK MAN
5. Is a team a better leader or a better chaser? -- IDK MAN
6. Are you more prone to win if you bat/ball first? -- IDK MAN
7. Won the toss AND won the match? -- OKAY 
8. Lucky venues for teams -- GOODISH
9. Total runs by each batsman

Possible Aggregations:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DELIVERIES

Analyses:
1. get team wise - avg over where most wickets took place -- IDK MAN 
    -- all teams are arounf 10-11. So not very insightful
2. Which ball/over does a certain batsman usually get out at? -- OKAY -- USE PHASE?
    -- inisghfull but too long
3. Which over does a batsman usually perform the best at? -- USE PHASE?
    -- GOOD RESULT, can be put into a graph
    -- Maybe get every 5 over top perfromers for each team.
    Something like batsman XYZ performs the best as opener and ABC as closer
4. Which bowler is a problem for a batsman? -- GOOD 
    -- Really good result - can even be plotted as interactive graph
    -- Approach? #wickets against a batsman by a bowler? 
5. best partnerships
6. Which bowler gave the most extras -- CLEAR 
7. Which bowler gave the most wcikets on average -- CLEAR 
8. Any relation between dismissial kind and the avg over at which it occurs? -- GOOD 
9. Most catches caught by feilder? -- CLEAR
10. Rolling avg of runs for each batter over past 5 matches
11. Divide the overs into phases


Possible Aggregations:
partnership - batter + non_striker

AGGREGATIONS 

1. Get the deliveries only for the final matches.

2. Table from deliveries, for total runs by each batsman in 
a matches and partnership total runs

Prediction model ideas

Given ball number, current score, current striker,innings
 and non-striker , bowler - what is the target score?

1. Create data such that for each balls-
get balls left, striker, non-striker - bowler pool and current score 
predict target score
prediction is based on balls left, batsmen pool, 
bowler pool and 

1. Match Outcome Prediction:
Objective: Predict the outcome of a match (which team will win).
Features: Venue, toss decision, toss winner, teams, player statistics, match type, etc.
Target: Match winner.
Approach: Classification problem using models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

2. Player Performance Prediction:
Objective: Predict a player's performance in terms of runs scored or wickets taken.
Features: Player's past performance, venue, opposing team, match type, etc.
Target: Runs scored or wickets taken.
Approach: Regression problem using models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

3. Inning Score Prediction:
Objective: Predict the total score of a team at the end of an inning.
Features: Runs scored till current over, wickets lost, venue, team batting, team bowling, etc.
Target: Total runs scored in the inning.
Approach: Regression problem using models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
